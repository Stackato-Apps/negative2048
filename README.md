- -2048 is very similar to the 2048 you know and love. However, along with 2's spawning on the board, -2's can spawn as well. 
- Two tiles with the same or opposite values will combine. Tiles with equal values add together as one would expect. 
- Opposite tiles combine to form a zero tile. The zero tile can combine with any tile.
- The sign of the tile (whether it is a 2 or -2) is determined by a percentage defined at the beginning of the game. So, the percentage of positive tiles will be between 35% and 65%.
- A 2048 or -2048 tile will "win" the game. 

## Deploying on Stackato

```
stackato push -n
```

## Scoring

- Merging of two equal tiles will reward double the positive value of the original tile (also the value of the new tile)
- Merging of two opposite tiles will also reward double the positive value of the original tile
- Merging of any tile and a zero tile will reward the positive value of the original tile
