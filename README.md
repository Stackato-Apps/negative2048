# Negative 2048 (or just -2048)
Inspired partially by [@tef](http://twitter.com/tef)'s [0](http://tef.github.io/0/)

- 2048 is very similar to the 2048 you know and love. However, along with 2's spawning on the board, -2's can spawn as well. 
- Two tiles with the same or opposite values will combine. Tiles with equal values add together as one would expect. 
- Opposite tiles combine to form a zero tile. The zero tile can combine with any tile.
- The sign of the tile (whether it is a 2 or -2) is determined by a percentage defined at the beginning of the game. So, the percentage of positive tiles will be between 35% and 65%.
- A 2048 or -2048 tile will "win" the game.
